## Unreleased
### Changed
- Updated to wf-template v5.6.2 to maintain compliance with our latest wf-template standard: this does not impact the workflow.

## [v1.0.0]

wf-teloseq is a new workflow designed to analyse the output of the Telo-Seq protocol.
Our v1.0.0 release supersedes the experimental beta release and is focused on a speedy analysis of telomeric lengths, either using a sample matched reference to measure telomere lengths per chromosome arm, or, if such a reference is not available, providing a per sample length profile for all input sequences which were identified as telomeric.
We look forward to seeing how this supports your research and discovery using the Telo-Seq protocol.
